See example.c for an implementation.
To convert it to an annotated source file, do:
$ ./process.pl example.c > example.meta_api.c
$ gcc -E -DMETA_API_SEMANTIC example.meta_api.c

- The implementation is made with a slightly altered version of C.
- Top-level comments should only be made with '//'.
  '/*' style comments are not supported by the parser.
- The first line of the file should be a '#define' for the datastructure.
- The curly braces for function bodies should not be indented (whitespace matters), and should be on their own line.

For function arguments:
- Append '$meta_instance' to the name to make the argument a pointer to the datastructure instance.
- Append '$meta_arg(DATATYPE)' to the name to make the argument a meta-API created type.

For function bodies:
- '$meta_setter(EFFECT);' one or more times to describe the effects of a setter.
- '$meta_getter;' to indicate the definition of a getter.
- '$meta_var(TYPE, NAME, DATATYPE);': declaration of the meta-API variables.
- To use a meta-API variable, prepend a '$' to the name.
