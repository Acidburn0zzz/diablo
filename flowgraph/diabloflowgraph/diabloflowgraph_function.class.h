/*! \brief Functions
 *
 * This class is used to represent the functions inside a cfg (t_cfg) of a
 * program. Functions in Diablo are sets of blocks, with a unique (virtual)
 * exit block (i.e. t_function::bbl_last). There are two main reason to have them:
 * collect information about them to threat callees as atomic
 * operations in the analysis of a caller, and to structure the
 * algorithms and our reasoning about transformations. As functions are also
 * stored as nodes in the callgraph (t_cg), this class extends
 * t_node. */
